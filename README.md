FTLSaver
========

An FTL Game Saver Application for iPad.

Description
------------
This is a spare-time project designed for me to dip my feet into the pool of Obj-C coding while fufilling a purpose useful to at least myself. The code itself is likely wretched, and design priciples flawed, but the point is to have fun. Anything useful that results is just a bonus

Caveats and Oddities
--------------------
As of right now, there are a few weird things you have to do to get the project to work. The first is to have theos installed in /var/theos. I build primarily on my device, and so this works well for me. The rest were resolved. ^.^ 

Lastly, you must have FTL installed from the App store for this to work. I hope you already figured that one out.
